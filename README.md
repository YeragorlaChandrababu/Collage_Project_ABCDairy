The first project was developed during Graduation

INTRODUCTION :
TITLE OF THE PROJECT: “DAIRY-COMPANY DETAILS AUTOMATION SYSTEM”
The Project “Dairy Company Details Automation System” Keeps Day to Day Records of 
the Company Secured and It Contains the Records of the Company Administrator, dealers of the 
Company, and Formers of the Company. It also contains the Everyday Milk production details of 
the Company. Mainly the Project Automates All the Manual Functions. The Name of the 
The company is “ABC – DAIRY” and the company is owned by 3 members “ASHOK,
BHANUPRASAD, CHAITANYA”. The Project is designed and Developed by " AMARJEETH 
SINGH.B, BHEEMRAY, YERAGORLA.CHANDRABABU(My Self).
Nowadays The Technology Growing Rapidly. But the Dairy Companies and the Dealers 
of the Companies are following Manual Records Only. Maintainance of the Manual Records is 
Complex And it Consumes Lot of time and We Need to Put a lot of Effort to Maintain Them 
Properly.
But this Project is Quite Different from the Difficulties mentioned above. In This Project 
Almost All the Processes are Automated. This Automation Reduces the Time Consumption and 
Paper Work And Manual Work of the Project Users. The Software is Light Weight and Easy to 
Use.
EXISTING SYSTEM AND IT’S DRAWBACKS :
The existing System Refers to the System that is being followed till now. The Existing 
system requires more Computational time, more manual calculation, and complexity. The 
other disadvantages are lack of Security for the data, Deficiency of Data Accuracy, Time 
Consumption, Etc. (Disadvantages elaborated in the below Section). To avoid all these 
Limitations and make the working more Accurately the System needs to be Computerized. 
The Existing System That is Still Followed by the Company has the following 
drawbacks.
1) Lack of Security of the Data.
2) More Man Power needed.
3) Time Consuming.
4) Consumes a large amount of Paperwork.
5) Need Manual Calculations.
6) Need to Carry the Records by Hand.
7) The Bugs and Insect May Damage the Paper-Based Records.
To Avoid all these Limitations and make the work more Accurate the System needs 
to be Computerized.
PROPOSED SYSTEM AND IT’S ADVANTAGES :
The proposed system aims to develop a System of improved facilities. The Proposed 
The system Can Overcome all the limitations of the existing system. The system Provides Proper 
security and reduces manual work. The Existing system has several disadvantages and many 
more difficulties to work well. The proposed system tries to eliminate or reduce these difficulties 
to some extent. The proposed system will help users to reduce their workload and mental 
conflict. The proposed system allows the user to work user-friendly and he can easily do his jobs 
without time lagging.
The Project Requires a Very minimum number of Resources and this will work in almost 
all configurations. The Project Contains a very simple UI, Easy to Understand and Use. The 
The project has got the Following Features.
1) Minimize Modular Data Entry.
2) Ensure Data Accuracy.
3) Minimum time needed for the Various Processing.
4) Greater Efficiency.
5) Better Service.
6) Easy Data Maintenance.
7) Easy Data Access.
8) The Data Online is Safe and Secure. (No Physical Damage Will Happen)
9) The Data can only able t Access by Authorized Persons Only.
In Addition, to these Features, We Can Able to add Some more New Features in the 
Feature. To the Project to Make the Project More Efficient
